======
cp prepare_genray_input.f90 prepare_cql3d_input.f90
Adjust for cql3d.



120821
======
New, more general prep/proc cql3d coding.  Provides framework
for most IPS cql3d uses, and is specifcally aimed at 
LH, RW, LH+RW, EC, in these instantiations.
IC addition should be straight-forward.

Committing prepare_cql3d_input.f90 process_cql3d_output.f90 
fp_cql3d_general.py, and updated *.f *.h files from the
cql3d cswim distribution, to cswim svn.

The cql3d distribution is at version="cql3d_cswim_120816_mpi".
prep/proc cql3d will (presumably) need additional debugging.

===========
Have (statically linked) cql3d:  
xcql3d_pgi.hopper and xcql3d_mpi.pgi.hopper
at
hopper07:/global/homes/u/u650/cql3d_cswim_svn/trunk
after having added delim='apostrophe' whereever might
affect namelist writes.

Added 
delim='apostrophe'
in prepare_cql3d_input.f90 open() statements.

Check my_ips_root/swim.bashrc.hopper is svn up to date.
swim  (==> PrgEnv-intel/4.1.40)

make succeeded.

======

PTB has added many fixes to BH's previous draft
prepare_cql3d_input.f90/process_cql3d_output.f90
Similarly, PTB has created a working (with IPS)
fp_cql3d_general.py.
PTB files are copied here.  BH adds delim='apostrophe'
stanza at 3 locations in prepare_cql3d_input.f90, plus
a few comments here and in process_cql3d_output.f90.
Do make, using up-to-date cql3d *.h files.

svn commit prepare_cql3d_input.f90 process_cql3d_output.f90 \
fp_cql3d_general.py README

NOTE: This cql3d driver, fp_cql3d_general.py, is designed to be
sufficient for all uses of
cql3d: For LH,EC,IC,RW,NBI, etc.
NOTE: Work remains to be done to upgrade the non-LH sections 
(EC,IC,NBI) to fixes PTB added for LH section.  
process_cql3d_output.f90 also needs checking as to whether
ptb fixes work for sections other than LH.



131031
======
Updated name_decl.h for character*256 filename paths, and 
param.h to present cql3d version.
Modified prepare_cql3d_input.f90 to use delim='apostrophe'
in open() for namelist read/write, but delim='none' in the
open() for formatted read/write in subroutine transcribe.
