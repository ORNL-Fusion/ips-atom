INTRODUCTION


This example test case run SOLPS-ITER using ips-wrappers. This wrapper is set 
up to operate SOLPS in any arbitrary directory. That is it does not require to
be run from inside the SOLPS install.


SETUP

To run this case the platform file included must be either modified to match the
parameters of the host machine, an existing platform file must be modified or 
environment variables for B2-Eirene install location must be set.

In all cases the following variables must be set:

IPS_SOLPS_COMP_PATH = /path/to/these/ips-wrappers/
IPS_B2_EIRENE_INSTALL_PATH = /path/to/b2-eirene/executable
IPS_B2_EIRENE_INSTALL_NAME = name.of.the.b2-eirene.executable


If modifying the existing platform.conf file the following variables should be 
modified if necessary:

IPS_PATH = /path/to/ips/framework/install

The parallel environment and provenance variables must also be set to match the 
current host environment.


The ips.solps-iter.config must be modified to set paths for the following 
variables:

SOLPSTOP = /path/to/base/directory/of/solps-iter
EIRENE_DATABASE_PATH = /path/to/eirene/database
INPUT_DIR = /path/to/inputfiles


RUNNING

To run this example call ips with

ips.py --simulation=ips.solps-iter.config --platform=platform.conf
